    <t>Congestion control is an essential element in ensuring fair bandwidth
       usage and preventing congesion collapse for traffic sharing the Internet.
       For interactive real-time media traffic such as video conferencing,
       design of congestion control solution also needs to account for
       many other factors such as the requirement for low latency packet delivery
       and interactions with live video encoder. 

       This document describes a common framework with core functional
       building blocks for proposed real-time media congestion solutions.

    <section title="Introduction">

    <t>Given increasing amount of interactive real-time media traffic
       over the Internet, such as video conferencing, it is important
       that these applications employ proper congestion control
       mechanisms so to avoid congestion collapse. The RTP Media
       Congestion Avoidance Techniques (RMCAT) working group was
       chartered to develop and standardize an effective congestion
       control solution. The working group document 
       <xref target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements"></xref>
       specifies the list of requirements of a viable solution.</t>

    <t>This document outlines a common framework for candidate
       congestion control solutions currently considered by
       the RMCAT working group. The framework contains several
       functionals modules that are needed for properly
       interacting with live media/video codec and network
       transport.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Common Terminology and Funtional Modules">
   
<t>A viable solution for real-time media congestion control needs
to comprise of several common modules. This section provides 
a brief description of them and their respective functionalities. 
It is required that drafts on candidate RMCAT solutions follow
a common set of terminologies. </t> 

<t><list style="symbols">

<t>Network Congestion Controller (NCC): this is the
core module for estimating available bandwidth over
the network based on periodic RTCP feedback reports from 
the receiver. Input of this module include periodic RTCP
feedback reports as well as shared states of other flows
in the same application sharing the same transport.
Output of this module is the estimated available 
bandwidth. This module contains key functions and
calculations required to detect congestion and estimate
available bandwidth on the transport. The statistics gather
via RTCP feedback reports are fed to this module for such
purpose. Different RMCAT solutions employ different
algorithms in detecting congestion and estimating
available bandwidth for its media flow. It also
possible that multiple media streams are multplexed
over a single transport, hence share the same congestion
control module in aggregation. 
</t>

<t>Transmission Queue: this module is needed
to absorb the instantaneous mismatch between
output from a live video encoder and regulated
outgoing traffic. The Transmission Queue schedules
outgoing traffic according to sending rate
recommended by the Rate Controller. It reports
back its occupancy level to the Rate Controller
module to assist its future decisions on target
video rate, sending rate, and probing/padding
rate. 
</t>

<t>Rate Controller: this module takes as input
the estimated available bandwidth from the 
Network Congestion Control module, shared states
on other flows, as well as occupancy level of
the Transmission Queue. It makes holistic decisions
on: a) target video rate for the live video
encoder; b) sending rate for regulating outgoing
traffic from the Transmission Queue; and c) 
rate of FEC/padding packets when needed. 
In the case where multiple media streams
share a single transport and a common Network
Congestion Controller (for estimating available
bandwidth in aggregation), the Rate Controller
is also responsible for distributing available
bandwidth amongst different media streams according
to their relative priorities and based on
Shared State information.</t>

<t>FEC/Padding Packet Generator: during periods of
bandwidth probing or when forward error protection is
needed during periods of likely packet losses, 
additional padding or or forward error correction (FEC)
packets are generated by the FEC/Padding Packet Generator.
While RMCAT solutions do not specify what FEC scheme to
use, nor how FEC or padding packets should be generated,
a complete congestion control solution needs tospecify
total rate of the FEC/Padding packets. Decision on how
the rate of FEC/padding is carried out by the Rate Controller
module. </t>

<t>
Live Video Encoder: the sender typically also contains a live
video encoder, which adjusts the its encoding parameters
according to the target video rate set by the Rate Controller.
The output rate from the Video Encoder may deviate from this
target due to uncertainty in the captured video content charasteristics
and the encoder rate control process. Note that internal 
operations of the Video Encoder (i.e., how video encoder rate
control works) is out of scope for RMCAT. This module is
should be considered as a black box as part of the RMCAT solution
framework.

shows an example configuration at the sender for 
supporting a single media stream. The Network Congestion
Controller (NCC) calculates estimated available
bandwidth (1) based on periodic RTCP feedback reports
and shared states about other streams.  The Rate Controller
takes as input the estimated available bandwidth (1), 
the current occupancy level of the Transmission Queue (2), 
as well as the shared states on other flows, and calculates
sending rate (3) for the Transmission Queue, video target
rate (4) as input to the live video encoder, and rate of
FEC/Padding packets (5) if they are needed. The Transmission
Queue holds output packets from both the Live Video Encoder
and the FEC/Padding packet generator, and regulates
its outgoing traffic according to the sending rate (3)
specified by Rate Controller. </t>

<t>Obviously, it is possible for a candidate RMCAT 
solution to contain alternative configurations (wirings)
between the functional modules, as well as alterantive
implementations of each function module. It is required
that the candidate solution draft specify how they align
to this framework. </t>

<t><xref target="fig-rmcat-solution-multi-stream"></xref> shows an example
configuration for multiple video streams sharing a common Network Congestion
Controller (NCC). The NCC calculates an aggregated estimated available
bandwidth (1) based on periodic RTCP feedback reports and Shared States (?). 
Based on such information and occupancy level of the transmission
queue for each substream (2), the Rate Controller divides up the aggregate
estimated bandwidth amongst sub-streams based on their relative priority levels, 
and subsequently regulates the sending rate of each Transmission Queue (3), 
target video rate (4), and FEC/padding rate (5) for each sub-stream. For
sake of abrevity the role of FEC/padding packet generators are omitted
in the above figure.   </t>
