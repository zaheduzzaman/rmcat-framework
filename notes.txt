<t>Upon receipt of a RTCP feedback report, the Network
Congestion Controller module calculates a reference 
rate (1) and feeds it to both the Video Rate
Controller and the Rate Shaping Buffer.  The Video Rate
Controller adjusts the target rate request to the video
encoder (2) based on both the reference rate and the 
current size in the Rate Shaping Buffer (3). Output
of the video encoder, in the form of RTP packet
streams (3) are first temporarily held at the 
Rate Shaping Buffer, and then sent to the tranport
layer at a regulated rate determined by the Rate Shaping
Buffer (5). Whenever needed (e.g., during periods of bandwidth
probing), additional FEC or padding packets (6) also join
the outgoing video stream via the Rate Shaping Buffer.
