     Framework for Real-time Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques
                      draft-zhu-rmcat-framework-00

Abstract

   Congestion control is an essential element in ensuring fair bandwidth
   usage and preventing congesion collapse for traffic sharing the
   Internet.  For interactive real-time media traffic such as video
   conferencing, design of congestion control solution also needs to
   account for many other factors such as the requirement for low
   latency packet delivery and interactions with live video encoder.
   This document describes a common framework with core functional
   building blocks for proposed real-time media congestion solutions.

1.  Introduction

   Given increasing amount of interactive real-time media traffic over
   the Internet, such as video conferencing, it is important that these
   applications employ proper congestion control mechanisms so to avoid
   congestion collapse.  The RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques
   (RMCAT) working group was chartered to develop and standardize an
   effective congestion control solution.  The working group document
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements] specifies the list of requirements
   of a viable solution.

   This document outlines a common framework for candidate congestion
   control solutions currently considered by the RMCAT working group.
   The framework contains several functionals modules that are needed
   for properly interacting with live media/video codec and network
   transport.

2.  Key Words for Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Common Terminology and Funtional Modules

   A viable solution for real-time media congestion control needs to
   comprise of several common modules.  This section provides a brief
   description of them and their respective functionalities.  It is
   required that drafts on candidate RMCAT solutions follow a common set
   of terminologies.

   o  Network Congestion Controller (NCC): this is the core module for
      estimating available bandwidth over the network based on periodic
      RTCP feedback reports from the receiver.  Input of this module
      include periodic RTCP feedback reports as well as shared states of
      other flows in the same application sharing the same transport.
      Output of this module is the estimated available bandwidth.  This
      module contains key functions and calculations required to detect
      congestion and estimate available bandwidth on the transport.  The
      statistics gather via RTCP feedback reports are fed to this module
      for such purpose.  Different RMCAT solutions employ different
      algorithms in detecting congestion and estimating available
      bandwidth for its media flow.  It also possible that multiple
      media streams are multplexed over a single transport, hence share
      the same congestion control module in aggregation.

   o  Transmission Queue: this module is needed to absorb the
      instantaneous mismatch between output from a live video encoder
      and regulated outgoing traffic.  The Transmission Queue schedules
      outgoing traffic according to sending rate recommended by the Rate
      Controller.  It reports back its occupancy level to the Rate
      Controller module to assist its future decisions on target video
      rate, sending rate, and probing/padding rate.

   o  Rate Controller: this module takes as input the estimated
      available bandwidth from the Network Congestion Control module,
      shared states on other flows, as well as occupancy level of the
      Transmission Queue.  It makes holistic decisions on: a) target
      video rate for the live video encoder; b) sending rate for
      regulating outgoing traffic from the Transmission Queue; and c)
      rate of FEC/padding packets when needed.  In the case where
      multiple media streams share a single transport and a common
      Network Congestion Controller (for estimating available bandwidth
      in aggregation), the Rate Controller is also responsible for
      distributing available bandwidth amongst different media streams
      according to their relative priorities and based on Shared State
      information.

   o  FEC/Padding Packet Generator: during periods of bandwidth probing
      or when forward error protection is needed during periods of
      likely packet losses, additional padding or or forward error

Internet-Draft               RMCAT framework                   July 2016


      correction (FEC) packets are generated by the FEC/Padding Packet
      Generator.  While RMCAT solutions do not specify what FEC scheme
      to use, nor how FEC or padding packets should be generated, a
      complete congestion control solution needs tospecify total rate of
      the FEC/Padding packets.  Decision on how the rate of FEC/padding
      is carried out by the Rate Controller module.

   o  Live Video Encoder: the sender typically also contains a live
      video encoder, which adjusts the its encoding parameters according
      to the target video rate set by the Rate Controller.  The output
      rate from the Video Encoder may deviate from this target due to
      uncertainty in the captured video content charasteristics and the
      encoder rate control process.  Note that internal operations of
      the Video Encoder (i.e., how video encoder rate control works) is
      out of scope for RMCAT.  This module is should be considered as a
      black box as part of the RMCAT solution framework.

   Figure 1 shows an example configuration at the sender for supporting
   a single media stream.  The Network Congestion Controller (NCC)
   calculates estimated available bandwidth (1) based on periodic RTCP
   feedback reports and shared states about other streams.  The Rate
   Controller takes as input the estimated available bandwidth (1), the
   current occupancy level of the Transmission Queue (2), as well as the
   shared states on other flows, and calculates sending rate (3) for the
   Transmission Queue, video target rate (4) as input to the live video
   encoder, and rate of FEC/Padding packets (5) if they are needed.  The
   Transmission Queue holds output packets from both the Live Video
   Encoder and the FEC/Padding packet generator, and regulates its
   outgoing traffic according to the sending rate (3) specified by Rate
   Controller.

   Obviously, it is possible for a candidate RMCAT solution to contain
   alternative configurations (wirings) between the functional modules,
   as well as alterantive implementations of each function module.  It
   is required that the candidate solution draft specify how they align
   to this framework.

    Figure 2: RMCAT Solution Framework at the Sender: Multiple Streams

   Figure 2 shows an example configuration for multiple video streams
   sharing a common Network Congestion Controller (NCC).  The NCC
   calculates an aggregated estimated available bandwidth (1) based on
   periodic RTCP feedback reports and Shared States (?).  Based on such
   information and occupancy level of the transmission queue for each
   substream (2), the Rate Controller divides up the aggregate estimated
   bandwidth amongst sub-streams based on their relative priority
   levels, and subsequently regulates the sending rate of each
   Transmission Queue (3), target video rate (4), and FEC/padding rate
   (5) for each sub-stream.  For sake of abrevity the role of FEC/
   padding packet generators are omitted in the above figure.
